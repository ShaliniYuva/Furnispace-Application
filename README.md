# Furnispace Application
In today's fast-paced world, purchasing furniture has become increasingly convenient through online platforms. However, many buyers still face a major challenge ‚Äî they often make purchasing decisions without truly understanding whether the furniture will fit well within their physical space or complement their home environment. As a result, customers frequently end up with furniture that is either too large, too small, or visually incompatible with their room layout.

The Furnispace Application was developed to address this common issue by leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) technology. This mobile application allows users to select furniture items and visualize them in their real environment using their smartphone camera ‚Äî all at true-to-life scale. Users can accurately place virtual furniture in their space before making a purchase, helping them make more confident and informed decisions.

The app also integrates key features such as a product catalogue, favourites management, add-to-cart functionality, and a convenient WhatsApp ordering system, making the entire shopping experience seamless and efficient.
